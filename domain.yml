The cuttings are planted with a spacing of 30 cm x 30 cm in a slanting position in the nursery bed measuring 30 cm x 1 m x 10 m. The bed is prepared with a mixture of 1:1:1 decomposed cowdung, soil and sand respectively.Leaf-bud cutting :Leaf-bud cutting should be taken from the branch having healthy well developed bud and actively growing leaves. The cuttings consist of a leaf blade and short piece of the stem measuring 2 cm. The nursery bed should be prepared with a mixture of leaf-mould, soil and sand in a ratio of 3:2:1. The cuttings are planted in rows 15 cm x 25 cm spacing and buried upto 2/3rd to their length in a slanting position.
